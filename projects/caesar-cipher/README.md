# Caesar Cipher

## Purpose
Implement a basic substitution cipher using loops, ASCII codes, and modular arithmetic.

## How it works
- Takes a message.
- Shifts letters by a fixed number.
- Wraps A–Z correctly.
- Leaves non-letters unchanged.

## Files
- cipher.py
- demo.txt

## What I learned
- ord() and chr()
- Looping through characters
- Simple input validation
- Function structure

## Next step
Add command-line options and tests.
